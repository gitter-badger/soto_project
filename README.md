## Projectomschrijving

Hello,

Finally managed to sit with JC and we both agree that 250 is accessible for a one question project. There are two main issues that we would like to solve:

1. Fly ID. The tracker we have now mixes fly identity when flies approach each other while moving fast, which complicates classifying flies.

2. Clustering: we would like to know if flies are close to each other at an specific distance and for how long. I've found it particularly difficult to do this time series clustering process beyond single frame analysis.

It would be great to know if your students are interested in solving these questions, if one person can take care of both, if different people would be involved, and if we could discuss an approximate time line.

Of course, each question is one challenge.

And it all will be prepared for publication, so we would agree on how to present each collaborator.

I'm back on the 12th, so we can meet that evening or the 13th to discuss details further and start as soon as we set a plan.


Thank you for your patience and help,
Andrea
